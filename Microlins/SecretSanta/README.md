# Secret Santa - English Class Interactive Game

Welcome! This project was created for a fun and engaging **Secret Santa** activity, designed especially for English language classes. The goal is to help students practice descriptive skills, vocabulary, and speaking in a playful context inspired by the American "Secret Santa" tradition.

## 🎯 **What is this project?**

This is a simple, visually appealing web page where each student receives a "Secret Santa" and must describe them using clues—without revealing their name. The clues are divided into three categories:

- **Appearance** (height, hair, eyes, etc.)
- **Personality** (funny, shy, creative, etc.)
- **Interests** (sports, music, reading, etc.)

There's also a button to generate random example clues in English, helping students understand how to phrase their own hints.

1. Open the page in any browser (desktop or mobile).
2. Students use the sub-cards to guide their English descriptions.
3. If someone is unsure how to give a clue, click "Get an example clue!" for inspiration.
4. The teacher can use this as a speaking, writing, or guessing game.

## 🙋‍♀️ **Why did I create this?**

I wanted to make my English classes more interactive and encourage students to describe people in English using real, fun cultural traditions. This dynamic helps with vocabulary, speaking, and creative thinking—all while having fun!
